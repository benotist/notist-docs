                    Click the + icon to start adding a new presentation. If this is a completely
                    new talk then select "New presentation", if you would like to start by copying
                    details from a previous talk then select Variation on an existing presentation".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If you are creating a Variation of an existing presentation we will then ask
                    you to choose which presentation, and also which of the assets related to that
                    presentation you would like to copy.
                    </p>
                    <p>At this point you can upload your slides if you have them.</p>
                    <p>
                    The next step is to assign this presentation to an event. So that we can see
                    if the event already exists on Notist we ask for the location and date and time
                    of the event, if we find matches we will show them to you so you can select one
                    if it is your event. If we find no matches, or this is another event to the ones
                    we show you, you can go on to add details of the event. See editing events for
                    more details.

                    <p>
                    You can now add the basic details of your presentation, saving these details
                    will save your presentation as a draft.

                    <p>
                    You have two options when adding a slidedeck to your presentation. If you have
                    a PDF file of your slides, then you can upload this directly to Notist. If your
                    slides are hosted elsewhere - for example of Slides.com - you can give us a link
                    and we will embed them on the presentation page.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Uploading a PDF</h4>
                    <p>
                    Export a PDF file from your presentation software and upload this file. If you
                    have presenter notes in your original deck and would like us to import those
                    as a description for your slide, add a second deck which is an export with notes
                    included.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Processing Your Slides</h4>
                    <p>
                    We will upload your slide deck(s) and try to extract any text from the slides
                    themselves and your speaker notes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Slides will be saved as images using the most appropriate format for the type
                    of content on the slide. We aim to keep your text crisp and images clear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This can take a little while, but you can leave the page and come back later.
                    </p>
                    <h4>After Uploading</h4>
                    <p>
                    You can now view and edit the deck, and make any changes to individual slides.
                    </p>

                    Every presentation tool is different, but here are some instructions for exporting
                    PDFs from common tools.

                    <h3 class="block-title" id="two-pdfs">Why two PDFs?</h3>
                    <p>
                    When you upload a slide deck to Notist, there's the option to add two different
                    PDFs. What's that all about?
                    </p>
                    <p>In summary:</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>
                        Always upload the Slidedeck PDF (first) file. This is used for creating your
                        slides.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The presenter notes PDF is optional, and is used for text only&nbsp;<em>in addition</em>
                        to the first PDF
                    </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Slidedeck PDF</h4>
                    <p>
                    The first upload field is for the slide deck PDF. This is your nice, pristine
                    set of slides that we will use to create the images that make up your slide deck
                    when shown on the presentation page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If you're uploading a deck, you always need to add this file. It's the important
                    one, the head honcho, the main deal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We have
                    <a href="#image-quality">some tips for getting the best quality</a>,
                    but if it's a reasonably recent deck (rather than something dusty you've dug
                    out from the early 2000s) you should be able to just export from Powerpoint or
                    Keynote and upload it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We'll then churn through and make it into images, and extract any text we find
                    on the slides and add that to the description field for each slide. This helps
                    in making notes, and can be useful for search indexing and for users who can't
                    read images well but might like the text.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Presenter notes PDF</h4>
                    <p>
                    The second field is for a copy of your presentation that has been exported with
                    the presenter notes turned on. This is entirely optional, and it only works if
                    you upload it alongside the main slide deck PDF. This is great for presenters
                    who make heavy use of notes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    You can create the presenter notes PDF by exporting from Powerpoint or Keynote
                    and enabling the "include presenter notes" option. This option then adds the
                    text from your presenter notes to the PDF alongside the image.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We then run through this second PDF and extract all that extra text, adding it
                    to the notes field for each slide. No images are used in this PDF - just the
                    text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    It's important if you use this option, that your presenter notes PDF has the
                    same number of pages as the main PDF. We match them up by page number, so whatever
                    notes are on Page 12 of the notes PDF get assigned to whatever slide is on Page
                    12 of the main slide deck PDF.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="block-title" id="image-quality">Getting the best image quality</h3>
                    <p>
                    We always want your slides to look their best on Notist, and we'll be improving
                    our PDF importer to make sure that's always the case. If you upload a slide deck
                    and find it looks a bit low-res, or is rotated strangely, here's a quick fix
                    you can try.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Delete the old deck</h4>
                    <p>
                    You don't want those crummy, fuzzy, low-res images so in the Slidedeck editor,
                    scroll to the bottom and use the red Delete This Deck button to get rid.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Re-save your PDF</h4>
                    <p>
                    PDFs are scalable vector files, so they should look good at any size. They usually
                    come coded with a default size, which is set to match a projector. Most projectors
                    actually use very low resolutions, especially compared to the nice big images
                    we want on Notist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If we use images at that size, they'll look rubbish. We can get around it by
                    re-saving the PDF to target a larger output size.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <em>(We're working adding better intelligence to the process to get around this.)</em>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Using Preview on a Mac</h4>
                    <p>
                    Open your PDF in Preview, and then go to <em>File &gt; Print</em>. We'll not
                    be printing the PDF, but instead save it out as a new PDF.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Under <em>Paper Size</em>, select <em>Manage Custom Sizes</em>. We're going to
                    create a custom paper size, so click the plus button at the bottom of the list.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Depending on whether your slides are widescreen or not, set your new paper to
                    the following sizes.

                    <p>
                    Give your new paper size a name (something like "Slides widescreen" or "Slides
                    4:3" might be helpful next time) and OK the changes.

                    If the preview looks good, in the PDF dropdown in the bottom left, select the

                    Events typically get added when a presentation is created. If we can't find an
                    event in the location and at the date and time you enter, we will ask you for
                    the title of the event in order to create it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As the person who created an event you will also be able to edit the other details.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Events can also be added outside of the Presentation creation process. Add an
                    event at this link and, as with the account creation process we will check to
                    see if it already exists before creating it.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="block-title" id="edit-event">Editing an event</h3>
                    <p>
                    If you added an event then you can also edit the event details. You will see
                    an edit bar on the event page if this is the case.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    On the event edit page you can provide some additional details about the event
                    such as a URL, event hashtag, and a description.

                    <p>
                    Events typically get into Notist when someone creates a presentation. If you
                    are an event organiser you can also create your event in Notist, however you
                    may discover that someone has already created your event and want to update the

                    If you can provide us with a way of confirming that you own this event in some
                    way then we will be happy to give you the right to edit it. You'll need a profile
                    for us to assign it to, so make sure you're logged in and have a username. Then
                    raise a support ticket with a link to the event in question and a way for us
                    to confirm you, and we'll sort it out.

                    <p>
                    Notist Pro subscribers have the option to configure a custom domain name to point
                    to their profile and presentations on Notist. This enables you to share content
                    on a domain you control, so if you decided to stop using Notist in the future
                    all those incoming links would still point to your domain and not ours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    When using a custom domain, links on the main Notist site point to your custom
                    domain, and any existing links are redirected.
                    </p>
                    <h4>The process</h4>
                    <p>
                    Setting up a custom domain is a four-step process. Don't panic, they're easy
                    steps.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Add a DNS record to point your domain to us</li>
                    <li>
                        Request the custom domain from the Settings section of your account
                    </li>
                    <li>We then flip some switches to make it work</li>
                    <li>When you're ready, you check a box to make it all active</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                    We'll attempt to explain those steps below, but the DNS bit is the only tricky
                    part.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Add a DNS record&nbsp;</h4>
                    <p>
                    In order to point your domain to Notist, you need to create a CNAME record and
                    point it to:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <code>inbound.noti.st</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    A CNAME record is like an alias that points from one domain name to another.
                    How precisely you create this will be down to your DNS provider. They should
                    have documentation to help if it's not obvious.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Once you have the CNAME configured and propagated, visiting your domain should
                    show you the Notist homepage. This demonstrates that DNS is configured correctly,
                    so the next step is to tell us to look out for it.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Requesting the custom domain</h4>
                    <p>
                    Log into your account and go to Settings from your profile menu. In the menu
                    (left hand side for desktop users) there's a link for Custom Domain. If you don't
                    see that you may not have a Pro account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    On the Custom Domain page, enter the domain name you've chosen, e.g.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <strong>presentations.example.com</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Submit the form to make the request. This will both save your preferences and
                    raise a support ticket for us to get it configured for you. We'll use this support
                    ticket to keep you updated.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Making it live</h4>
                    <p>
                    Once we've configured the domain, you'll be able to view your Notist profile
                    using it. However, your pages will still be active on the noti.st domain. To
                    start sending all the traffic through your custom domain, go back to Settings
                    and Custom Domain and check the "Enable this custom domain" box.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Once that's in place, all your presentations and profile links will point to
                    the versions of your pages on your custom domain.

                    <p>
                    If you have presentations already created which do not have a slide deck listed,
                    then select <strong>add this deck to an existing presentation</strong>. A list
                    of talks with no slides will appear and you can choose the appropriate talk.
                    As we then already have the information for the talk we can go straight into
                    processing the slides.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If you don't want to list these slides, or they are a duplicate of some you already
                    added before the import was available, then choose
                    <strong>I don't need this. Throw it away</strong>, and we will get rid of it
                    from your list.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Any problems during the process, then raise a ticket in support and we'll help
                    you out.

                    <h3 class="block-title" id="export-api">Exporting data from your account</h3>
                    <p>We are very keen that your data is not locked up inside our platform. It belongs to you and you should be able to keep a backup of it, or take it somewhere else in future in an easily usable manner. So we will be offering full export of data held in Notist.
                    <p>
                    During the beta data export is not yet available, essentially because some features are in flux that would require changes to any export scripts. We also want to work with beta testers to make sure the exports are useful. We'll add this in the coming weeks.
                    <p>
                    You can already access and use a lot of the data via JSON, from publicly accessible pages. For example, you can add .json to the end of any profile page URL.
                    <p>
                    <code>https://noti.st/username.json</code>
                    <p>
                    For a presentation page, remove the slug and add .json to the presentation ID:
                    <p>
                    <code>https://noti.st/username/aAbAcC.json</code>
                    <p>
                    And similarly for an event:
                    <p>
                    <code>https://noti.st/events/aAbAcC.json</code>
